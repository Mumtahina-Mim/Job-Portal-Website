# User Account

---


    Users are the main part of our system and this part will handle
    all the user information like admin, job seeker, employer etc.
    The most valuable part in our project is this section.

    
    Some of user information will appear in this section like(email, phone
    number etc.). There will be a logout button, an user can easily logout
    from the system by pressing the button.

    
    Some sort of CSS programs are added here because to make our project
    look good. As we all know that to make a project user friendly the 
    developer should focused on the user interface of the project. Because
    if the user interface is not looks so good then the user won't be able
    to understand the concept of the features and start to feel bad and at 
    certain of time the user will not use the system. To make our system user 
    friendly we need a very clear and nice user interface and this vital
    works in done here.
