  If an user wish to deactivated his profile it is obious to
  do so and the system will help the user to do that. For 
  deleting an account from our server the system will appear a 
  delete account button and if the user click the button all of 
  the information provided by the user will be automatically deleted
  from the system. 

  
  By pressing the delete account the user will be able to delete the
  account from the server permanently.
